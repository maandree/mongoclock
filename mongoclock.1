.SH RATIONALE
It is really nice to have a large clock on your
computer, instead of a small clock somewhere in
your room, when your are sleeping. It is also
nice to have a glansable clock available on your
netbook for when you need to keep track of the
time but are not working on a computer.
Pocket-watches are just too much work to getting
up, opening, closing, and putting down, and you
would not like to forget it when you leave if
you are in a public place.
