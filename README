Just a humongous clock for the terminal

Type mongoclock in the terminal and it will either,
depending on the terminal size, show the time HH:MM
or HH:MM:SS with humongous digits.

If the terminal is too small, it will not run.


mongoclock is designed to be fit on most screens
and be readable from all practical distances, so
that it can be used in place of a standard wall-
or alarm-clock. If the font is not big enough for
your (or if it is too large,) just change the
font size on your terminal. If it is not the
right colour for you, simply change the font
colour on your terminal. â˜º
